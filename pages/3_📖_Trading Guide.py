st.markdown('<div style="text-align: justify;">Japanese rice traders are responsible for the creation of candlestick patterns. In his 1991 book Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques, Steve Nison shared these patterns with the West for the first time. Since then, the stock market has been analysed using these candlestick patterns to visualise share price fluctuations. An analyst can forecast changes in share price using these trends. Data from a chosen time frame is combined into one candle bar in candlestick charts. Each candlestick represents activity over a specific period, such as a minute, hour, day, or month. They provide information about price changes for an investment. As a result, a candlestick will display the open, close, high, and low data points for the selected time frame. The colour codes make it clear about changes in the price. Bullish (positive) candlesticks are denoted by green or white, whereas negative bearish(negative) candlesticks are denoted by the colours red or black. occur many times over some time, chart patterns can generally be trusted.</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)

st.subheader("_Triangle Pattern_ -")
st.markdown('<div style="text-align: justify;">Triangles are most appropriately characterized as horizontal trading patterns. The triangle has maximum width in the beginning. In its most basic form, the triangle depicts waning interest in stocks from both the buy-side and the sell-side: the supply line narrows to satisfy the demand. The trading range narrows and the triangle point is established as the market keeps moving in a sideways pattern. A trend line is a line created over or under pivot highs or lows to represent the current price direction. Such sequences can help investors to understand what the future movement of the stock could be. There are numerous advantages to adopting triangle patterns since they not only signal if a trend will gain momentum or reverse but can also reveal how far the trend continuance or reversal will reach, which can help you evaluate your return-to-risk ratio for the trade. Furthermore, understanding a specific profit target depending on the formed triangles length might help develop and refine your money management approach.</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)

st.markdown('<div style="text-align: justify;">A statistic known as a moving average measures the typical change over time in a data collection. Moving averages are frequently employed in finance by technical analysts to monitor price patterns for certain stocks. While a negative trend would be interpreted as a sign of deterioration, an upward trend in a moving average could indicate an increase in the price or momentum of an asset. Moving averages come in a wide range of types nowadays, from straightforward measurements to intricate formulas that must be efficiently calculated by a computer program.

st.markdown("Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD, or MAC-D) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a securityâ€™s price. The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, which is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals. Traders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sellâ€”or shortâ€”the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.")

st.markdown("The relative strength index is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis (RSI). The RSI, which measures the speed and magnitude of recent price fluctuations, is used to evaluate overvalued or undervalued situations in a security's price. The RSI is represented as an oscillator on a scale of 0 to 100. (a line graph). J. Welles Wilder Jr. revealed the indicator he created in his seminal 1978 book New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems. The RSI is useful for more than just identifying overbought and oversold securities. It could also indicate that equities are about to experience a trend reversal or a price correction. It can be used as a buy/sell signal. Historically, an RSI rating of 70 or higher indicates a problem.")
